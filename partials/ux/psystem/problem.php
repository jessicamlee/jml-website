            <h2>The Problem&colon; What is it &amp; Why Now</h2>
            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>Psystem is a health and wellness company that was in need of a website redesign as the brand colours, styles, and marketing focus changed to support an upcoming social media marketing campaign to use the webpages as advertisements (or “ad”) landing pages to increase coaching appointments bookings and newsletter signup conversions.</p>
            <p>A few of the technical issues included a lack of a responsive web experience for mobile users, misuse of headings for Search Engine Optimization (SEO) performance, and unstreamlined webpages for scannable content that would encourage users to take action to increase conversions.</p>
            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
            <p>How might we help mobile users so that mobile users can easily access information to learn more about and sign up for Psystem’s services without feeling overwhelmed by the new information?</p>
            <h3>Goal</h3>
            <p class="cs-goal-highlight">Redesign the Coaching Services, Webinar, Toolkit Signup, and App web pages so users can easily access a responsive, mobile-first user experience when navigating from Instagram ad redirects to the website.</p>
            <h3>Approach&colon; Empathize → Define → Ideate → Iterate → Test</h3>
            <p>Being the only designer for this project, I followed a variation of the Design-Thinking concept by replacing the Prototype phase with the Iterate phase. I made this decision because the iteration for this project primarily focused on creating and optimizing static ad landing pages.</p>
            <p>To encourage users to continue discovering more about Psystem’s offerings, I took the initiative to suggest an update for Psystem’s Global and Footer Navigation menu sections to support an intuitive exploration of Psystem’s website.</p>
