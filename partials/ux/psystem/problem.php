            <h2>Problem&colon; What &amp; Why Now&quest;</h2>
            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>Psystem is a health and wellness company that was in need of a website redesign as the brand colours&comma; styles&comma; and marketing focus changed to support an upcoming social media marketing campaign to use the webpages as advertisements &lpar;or &ldquo;ad&rdquo;&rpar; landing pages to increase coaching appointments bookings and newsletter signup conversions&period;</p>
            <p>A few of the technical issues included a lack of a responsive web experience for mobile users&comma; misuse of headings for Search Engine Optimization &lpar;SEO&rpar; performance&comma; and unstreamlined webpages for scannable content that would encourage users to take action to increase conversions&period;</p>
            <div class="cs-problem-stmt">
                <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
                <p>How might we <span class="bolded-italic">help mobile users</span> so that <span class="bolded-italic">mobile users can easily access information to learn more about and sign up for Psystem&apos;s services without feeling overwhelmed by the new information</span>&quest;</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Goal</h3>
            <p class="cs-goal-highlight">Redesign the Coaching Services&comma; Webinar&comma; Toolkit Signup&comma; and App web pages so users can easily access a responsive&comma; mobile-first user experience when navigating from Instagram ad redirects to the website&period;</p>
            <h3>Approach</h3>
            <h4>Empathize → Define → Ideate → Iterate → Test</h4>
            <p>Being the only designer for this project&comma; I followed a variation of the Design-Thinking concept by replacing the Prototype phase with the Iterate phase&period; I made this decision because the iteration for this project primarily focused on creating and optimizing static ad landing pages&period;</p>
            <p>To encourage users to continue discovering more about Psystem&apos;s offerings&comma; I took the initiative to suggest an update for Psystem&apos;s Global and Footer Navigation menu sections to support an intuitive exploration of Psystem&apos;s website&period;</p>
