        <h2>Solution&colon; The How</h2>
        <h3>Empathize</h3>
        <p>The first step I took was to understand Psystem&apos;s competitors&comma; market&comma; and users and further specify the problem to resolve for the website experience by conducting primary and secondary research&period;</p>
        <h4>Primary Research&colon; Interviewing Psystem&apos;s Founder</h4>
        <p>I conducted primary research by interviewing Psystem&apos;s founder who suffers from chronic pain and the Vice President of Operations who is a caretaker of a loved one who suffers from chronic pain&period;</p>
        <p>I asked the following questions to learn about their current experience and expectations for the website that has or has yet to be implemented&colon;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What aspects of the website do you currently like&quest;</li>
            <li>What aspects of the website would you like to see more of&quest;</li>
            <li>What would you like to explore on the Coaching Services page&quest;
            &lpar;This question was repeated for all the pages to evaluate what can be improved from its current state&period;&rpar;</li>
            <li>What was something you wanted to learn more about chronic pain management coaching services before the Psystem website was created&quest;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>From the interviews&comma; I learned about the obstacle of not having everything in one place to intuitively find and retrieve when needed&comma; especially when a chronic pain sufferer or their caretaker experiences feelings of discomfort&comma; anxiety&comma; depression&comma; and stress&period; </p>
        <p>For the business aspect&comma; there was a <span class="bolded">lack of clarity and cohesiveness</span> on Psystem&apos;s website for chronic pain sufferers and caretakers to <span class="bolded">quickly find information about services</span> and <span class="bolded">sign up for a coaching appointment</span>&comma; which would lead to increased conversions&period;</p>
        <h4>Secondary Research&colon; Understanding what&apos;s &ldquo;out there&rdquo;</h4>
        <p>The secondary research focused on finding and learning about health and wellness coaches who have similar business models&comma; needs&comma; and websites to provide both informative and actionable content for visitors to learn about the services and book their first appointment or subscribe to the newsletter&period;</p>
        <p>I also compared various landing page examples to Psystem&apos;s current page layouts to analyze and create a general outline for an optimized webpage layout to manage user expectations and create a balance of informative content and call&dash;to&dash;action sections for the entire experience&period;</p>

    </div>
    <div class="container cs-section">
        <h3>Define</h3>
        <p>From my observations&comma; I defined 3 key user story statements to synthesize my research insights and findings to summarize how I would be empathizing with Psystem&apos;s users for the webpage updates&period;</p>
        <h4>Key Research Insights</h4>
        <p>The key research insights I gathered from the user interviews include the following&colon;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 of 5 participants <span class="bolded">expressed interest in learning more about a specific service</span> on a dedicated page aside from the main services page to not feel confused by a lot of information on one webpage&period;</li>
            <li>All of the participants <span class="bolded">noted the lack of cohesive appearance</span> for the font family&comma; font weight&comma; and font sizes that distracted them and questioned their trust in the content at different points on a webpage&period;</li>
            <li>3 of 5 participants <span class="bolded">noted the navigation menus lacked consistency</span> or did not redirect them to the page they wanted to learn more from&period;</li>
            <li>All of the participants highlighted different aspects they <span class="bolded">wanted to learn more about</span> on the Webinar and Services pages but <span class="bolded">lacked the expected structure</span> on the desktop and mobile experiences to not be distracted by the unconventional layout&period;</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>User Stories</h4>
        <p>From the key research insights&comma; I created user stories to prioritize for this website update&colon;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>As a chronic pain sufferer who frequently uses their mobile phone&comma; I want to comfortably read information easily on the services webpage using my mobile phone&comma; so that I can decide if Psystem&apos;s services are what I need for my chronic pain management journey&period;</li>
            <li>As a caretaker for a chronic pain sufferer&comma; I want to quickly find information about Psystem&apos;s webinars&comma; so that I can register for upcoming informational sessions about how I can care for my loved one and myself&period; </li>
            <li>As a chronic pain sufferer who cannot sit for long sessions at a desk&comma; I want to navigate the website from my tablet device&comma; so that I can learn about Psystem&apos;s free resources in a non&dash;seated position&period;</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="container cs-section">
        <h3>Ideate</h3>
        <p>Drawing inspiration from the competitor research and Psystem&apos;s initial webpage layouts for the Webinar and Services pages&comma; I sketched with pen and paper by applying the How Might We mindset to brainstorm and ideate various options to modify and optimize the Webinar and Services pages to provide more value to users while increasing user engagement&period;</p>
        <p>With the sketches&comma; I selected the most impactful layouts to transfer into a digital low&dash;fidelity format to share 3 variations with Psystem&apos;s founder and project manager for a design review to get feedback and iterate before creating the high&dash;fidelity mockups&period;</p>

        </div>
        <h4>Setting expectations&colon; The Iterative Design Process and WCAG</h4>
        <p>In this phase&comma; I took the opportunity to set expectations with the stakeholders about an iterative design process that would keep costs low when prioritizing low&dash;fidelity wireframe iterations during the process of finalizing the layout and content for the webpages before moving forward with building the designs&period;</p>
        <p>During this conversation&comma; I highlighted the importance of taking additional steps toward a more accessible website design by abiding by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines &lpar;WCAG&rpar;&period;</p>
        <p>I proposed adjusting the hover states in the navigation menus&comma; button sizes for tablet and mobile users&comma; and typography for each screen size range to support a responsive website user experience&period;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container cs-section">
        <h3>Iterate</h3>
        <p>The design review and feedback process was a combination of sharing my work and process and taking note of the entire team&apos;s initial impressions&period;</p>
        <p>The comments that had the most weight were from the project manager&sol;founder when they explained to me how they felt when they looked at each layout and section of the redesigned pages&period;</p>
        <p>The 3 redesigned web pages that evolved the most are the Discover&comma; Webinar&comma; and Blog pages&period;</p>
        <h4>Discovering a more engaging way to highlight Psystem</h4>
        <p>The Discover page is the landing page to summarize what Psystem is and its various offerings including coaching services&comma; the PsyHealth App&comma; business consultations&comma; webinars&comma; and pathway courses&period;</p>
        <p>The key changes to the &ldquo;Why Psystem&rdquo; section between the initial medium&dash;fidelity wireframe and the final design are the following&colon;</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="bolded">Redistributed 3 Highlights to Opportunity Space &num;2</span> below the video on the right&dash;hand side to remove the juxtaposition to the video and create visual balance&period;</li>
            <li><span class="bolded">Reformatted the text</span> below the section heading to make the content more scannable and enjoyable to read for mobile readers&period;</li>
            <li><span class="bolded">Maximized opportunity space</span> to include stakeholder input while maintaining visual appeal and balance between the written copy&comma; video&comma; and graphical content&period;</li>
            <li><span class="bolded">Added visual balance and a focal point</span> to guide users when consuming the content for the first time&comma; especially toward the embedded video content&period;</li>
        </ul>

        </div>
        <h4>Making Webinar Event cards interesting  </h4>
        <p>The primary call&dash;to&dash;action for the Webinar Event cards section on the Webinar page was to guide users to sign up for the upcoming webinar&period;</p>
        <p>From learning about the team&apos;s thought processes from a first glance at the iterations&comma; I modified the original wireframe in 3 steps as follows&colon;</p>
        <ol>
            <li><span class="bolded">Noticed a lack of focal point</span> ith the 3 webinar cards every odd row and 2 cards every even row grid pattern&period; The users&apos; eyes were drawn toward the larger 2&dash;card row first instead of the first row&period;</li>
            <li><span class="bolded">Revised to 2&dash;column grid layout</span> to restore balance to this force and prioritize the larger cards to capture and maintain user&apos;s attention&period; It still wasn&apos;t enough&semi; I iterated one more round of possibilities&period;</li>
            <li><span class="bolded">A focal point was achieved</span> while maintaining the balanced grid layout from Version 2 to guide users to the latest&comma; upcoming webinar to sign up for first before revealing the past webinars they cannot sign up for&period;</li>
        </ol>

        </div>
        <h4>Keeping the Blog simple and easy to read</h4>
        <p>The original Blog page was not as established as the other web pages&comma; which gave me the creative freedom to experiment with how might I approach the redesign&period;</p>
        <p>Taking inspiration from existing blog page layouts like Medium and news media websites&comma; I started with the following iteration&colon;</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="bolded">Simple Block display of a blog article card</span> to visualize how much space an article card could take up before it started to not meet user expectations&period;</li>
            <li><span class="bolded">Add visual interest</span> by taking inspiration from the Webinar page and meeting user expectations to see the 3 cards per row layout&period;</li>
            <li><span class="bolded">Webflow Article Component constraints</span> led to another iteration to revise the card appearance to support a more efficient way for Psystem&apos;s staff to publish content based on Webflow&apos;s setup&period;</li>
        </ul>

        </div>
        <h4>Creating Psystem&apos;s Style Tile</h4>
        <p>I proposed adding a tertiary colour to highlight call&dash;to&dash;action sections and was grateful to test and review the idea with the founder to check that it adds value to their visual user experience while positively contributing to Psystem&apos;s brand colours and supporting the landing page initiatives&period;</p>
        <p>To make my process more efficient&comma; I summarized Psystem&apos;s colours&comma; typography&comma; button styles&comma; and interaction details into a style guide for future designers working with Psystem&apos;s offerings and to maintain cohesive brand recognition for Psystem&apos;s other offering&comma; the PsyHealth mobile application&period;</p>

            <p class="cs-img-caption">Style tile to summarize key styles I reused throughout the redesign process for the high&dash;fidelity mockups&period;</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="container cs-section">
        <h3>Test</h3>
        <p>Since the pages were static landing pages&comma; the testing phase was modified by using Webflow&apos;s Staging Domain URL to gather feedback from internal testers about the high&dash;fidelity mockups approved by the founder&period;</p>
        <p>Throughout the design process&comma; I researched the implementation in Webflow&apos;s Designer interface to ensure the feasibility of the ideas and suggestions I shared with Psystem&apos;s founder&period;</p>
        <p>I reviewed the available features on Webflow to familiarize which aspects would be made from scratch or dragged and dropped from Webflow&apos;s pre&dash;made components&period;</p>
        <h4>&ldquo;Testing&rdquo; using Webflow&apos;s Staging Domain</h4>
        <p>After translating all of the updates&comma; I shared the staging domain URL with the founder and the internal user testers to conduct an informal usability study to learn about the following&colon;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How well users can navigate from page to page using the updated navigation menus in the global and footer sections&comma;</li>
            <li>The users&apos; first impressions of how the content is organized help them learn more about Psystem&apos;s services&comma; and</li>
            <li>How easily users can find where and how to book a coaching appointment and subscribe to Psystem&apos;s newsletter&period;</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Discovering a minor yet impactful pain point</h4>
        <p>From testing using the Staging Domain&comma; I gathered an additional insight about a &ldquo;nice&dash;to&dash;have&rdquo; feature to reduce endless scrolling that affects the users&apos; thumb mobility&mdash;the &ldquo;Back to Top&rdquo; button&period;</p>
        <p>I asked follow&dash;up questions during this discussion to learn about the user&apos;s expectations for where a &ldquo;Back to Top&rdquo; button would best support their experience in addition to learning more about how they interact with the interface as a right&dash;handed dominant user&period;</p>

            <img class="img-thumb" src="images/case-studies/psystem/psystem_backtotop_mobile.jpg" alt="Mobile screens of Psystem's website with and without a Back to Top button shortcut">
            <p class="cs-img-caption">The Before and After of the mobile screen size showcases the difference of having a Back to Top button to make the user&apos;s experience more enjoyable and accessible&period;</p>

            <p class="cs-img-caption">The Before and After of the tablet screen size showcases the difference of having a Back to Top button on a larger screen&period;</p>
        </div>
        <p>With my observations and a few proposed options&comma; I got approval to test the &ldquo;Back to Top&rdquo; button on the Staging Domain by placing the button at the bottom left corner of the screen to avoid conflicting with the call&dash;to&dash;action booking button that is placed at the bottom right corner of the screen for the Services page&period;</p>
        <p>After another round of testing on the Staging Domain space&comma; the goals for this project were met&comma; the users were happy with having their needs met for the scope of this project&comma; and the founder expressed their appreciation for how the pages were updated sooner than the anticipated timeline&period;</p>
