        <h2>The Design Sauce&colon; How in the World&quest;</h2>
        <h3>Empathize</h3>
        <p>I engaged in interviews with Psystem&apos;s founder and Vice President of Operations who are both familiar with chronic pain&period;</p>
        <h4>Elevating user experiences by identifying existing pain points</h4>
        <p>During the user interviews&comma; I wanted to learn about the user&apos;s current experience and expectations for the website&period;</p>
        <p>Through user interviews and empathetic follow&dash;up questions&comma; I pinpointed the following areas to enhance on each web page&colon;</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="bolded">Scattered details</span> instead of quickly finding information <span class="bolded">from one place</span>&semi;</li>
            <li><span class="bolded">Unclear coaching appointment signups</span> due to lack of content cohesiveness&semi; and</li>
            <li><span class="bolded">Incomplete experience</span> regarding insufficient information about Psystsem&apos;s sub-services&period;</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Spotting Opportunities like a Web Page Detective</h4>
        <p>I combed through Psystem&apos;s web pages like a digital detective to identify opportunity spaces for the redesign&period;</p>

        <h3>Define</h3>
        <p>From the research&comma; I translated key insights to bridge the gap between 3 relevant user stories and project goals&period;</p>
        <h4>Research Revelations</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="bolded">Curious minds seek focus&colon;</span> 2 of 5 participants craved a dedicated page to dive deeper into specific services without feeling like they were sinking into a pool of information&period;</li>
            <li><span class="bolded">Font Fashion Police&colon;</span> All participants raised an eyebrow or two at the font styles and preferred a cohesive style that wouldn&apos;t distract and boost trust in the content&period;</li>
            <li><span class="bolded">Navigation Nudges&colon;</span> 3 of 5 participants faced the wild ride of inconsistent menus and asked for a consistent roadmap&period;</li>
            <li><span class="bolded">Structured Sip of Information&colon;</span> Everyone&apos;s parched for knowledge&excl; Unfortunately&comma; both desktop and mobile experiences lacked the organization to make it easier to continue reading&period;</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>What Psystem&apos;s Users currently need</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="bolded">Mobile Maestro&colon;</span> For the mobile&dash;savvy chronic pain warrior&comma; I aim to make info easily digestible on the services page&period; Deciding on Psystem&apos;s offerings should be a breeze on your phone&excl;</li>
            <li><span class="bolded">Webinar Wizard&colon;</span> Calling all caretakers&excl; I&apos;m on a mission to help you swiftly locate and register for Psystem&apos;s webinars&period; Because who has time to waste when caring for a loved one and yourself&quest;</li>
            <li><span class="bolded">Tablet Trailblazer&colon;</span> If you&apos;re a chronic pain warrior who prefers tablet adventures&comma; embark on Psystem&apos;s free resources on its website in comfort in a non&dash;seated zone&period;</li>

        <h3>Ideate</h3>
        <p>I unleashed my inner artist and summoned How Might We statements to sketch ideas for boosting value and user excitement on each web page&period;</p>

        <h4>Micro changes for Macro Accessibility for all</h4>
        <p>In a chat with the project manager&comma; I showcased the wallet&dash;friendly perks of an iterative design approach&period; I advocated for a more accessible website&comma; aligning with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines &lpar;WCAG&rpar;&period;</p>
        <p>My design magic&quest;</p>

    <div class="container cs-section">
        <h3>Iterate</h3>
        <p>In the design review sessions&comma; I threw my creations into the spotlight&comma; basking in the team&apos;s initial reactions to actively listen to how to improve each page&period;</p>
        <p>Check out the redesigned Discover&comma; Webinar&comma; and Blog pages &mdash; the power trio to learn more about Psystem&excl;</p>
        <p>The 3 redesigned web pages that evolved the most are the Discover&comma; Webinar&comma; and Blog pages&period;</p>
        <h4>Discover Psystem&apos;s Healing Power</h4>
        <p>The revamped Discover page spills the beans on Psystem&apos;s coaching services&comma; PsyHealth app&comma; business consultations&comma; webinars&comma; and pathway courses&period;</p>
        <p>What&apos;s the charm behind &ldquo;Why Psystem&rdquo;&excl;</p>

        <ol>
            <li><span class="bolded">Spotted a visual hiccup</span> with odd&dash;even card chaos&comma; misguiding users and causing confusion&period;</li>

        <h4>Blog Bliss&colon; Keep it simple</h4>
        <p>The Blog page gave me the green light for a creative overhaul&period; Inspired by Medium and news media sites&comma; I started the redesign with a fresh twist&excl;</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="bolded">Started with a basic block display</span> to test the waters to prioritize user expectations&period;</li>

        <h4>Style Tile&colon; Crafting Design Harmony</h4>
        <p>I added a pop of tertiary colour for visual interest without stealing the spotlight from Psystem&apos;s main brand colours&period;</p>
        <p>Enter the style tile &mdash; my productivity buddy&excl;</p>

        <h3>Test</h3>
        <h4>Discovering a minor yet impactful pain point</h4>
        <p>I tested with the Webflow Staging Domain URLs due to the time constraint with our in&dash;house testers to answer the following questions&colon;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How well users can navigate from page to page using the updated navigation menus in the global and footer sections&comma;</li>
            <li>The users&apos; first impressions of how the content is organized help them learn more about Psystem&apos;s services&comma; and</li>
            <li>How easily users can find where and how to book a coaching appointment and subscribe to Psystem&apos;s newsletter&period;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I discovered a “nice-to-have” feature &mdash; the &ldquo;Back to Top&rdquo; button &mdash; to conclude the endless scroll saga&comma; saving users&apos; thumbs from an uncalled&dash;for workout for left and right&dash;handed mobile users&period;</p>
