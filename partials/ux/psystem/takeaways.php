        <h2>Takeaways</h2>
        <p>For an internship experience&comma; I am grateful to have the opportunity to take the lead in updating the select webpages to support Psystem&apos;s upcoming marketing campaign and business goals in driving conversions and providing informative value and resources to their users&period;</p>
        <h3>âœ¨ How my work impacted the website</h3>
        <p>To track the visitors on the website while advocating for cookie consent&comma; I got permission to add a Cookie Consent app provided by Elfsight&period; The regular updates from Elfsight&apos;s insight reveal <span class="bolded">more than 200 monthly view visits</span> 2 weeks into the month&comma; which was an increase of around 33&percnt; in website visits&period;</p>

        <p>Psystem&apos;s founder expressed <span class="bolded">appreciation for bringing their vision to life</span> with limited visual references provided to me&period; Including them in every step within and beyond the design process provided more confidence to them about how the project was progressing and set clear expectations for the end result&period;</p>

        <h3>ðŸŒ± What I learned</h3>
        <p>While I learned a lot more about myself when putting my user experience design and research&comma; project management&comma; and curious learning mindset to the test&comma; the most memorable lessons I learned are the following&colon;</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="bolded">Research is my best friend</span> whether I am trying to learn more about the competitors&comma; users&comma; market&comma; expectations&comma; or technologies used to implement the design&comma; there is always something for me to learn and consider in the empathizing and planning stages of a project&semi;</li>
            <li><span class="bolded">Asking about the existing research</span> to learn more about what the company has established or may not have explored yet also further validates the product-market fit that can influence the design process&semi;</li>
            <li><span class="bolded">Starting the conversation early with stakeholders</span> to set expectations about an iterative design process helped me demonstrate my domain knowledge and care for the design and business&apos;s resources from a project management standpoint&semi;</li>
            <li><span class="bolded">Asking questions reduces future problems</span> as everyone can have different interpretations and connotations of the same idea&comma; so good communication helps to ensure everyone involved arrives at the same agreed-upon end result&semi; and</li>
            <li><span class="bolded">Providing regular updates</span> through messages and video conferences early on sets the expectation to encourage constant&comma; good communication throughout the project&comma; which is especially helpful if or when a problem arises&period;</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>ðŸ“Œ Next Steps</h3>
        <p>To further optimize the webpages to increase conversions&comma; I would like to</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="bolded">Learn what is and is not supporting an intuitive and accessible user experience</span> across all of Psytem&apos;s webpages by analyzing the Key Performance Indicators &lpar;KPIs&rpar; and other measured analytics&semi;</li>
            <li><span class="bolded">Conduct more formal usability tests</span> with users beyond Psytem&apos;s internal testers to learn about overlooked behaviour and pain points that can be addressed to make the website more accessible for chronic pain sufferers and their caretakers&semi; and</li>
            <li><span class="bolded">Research more on the website&dash;to&dash;mobile application user journey</span> to support a seamless user journey that supports Psystem&apos;s business goals in connecting the value of the website and the mobile application&apos;s functionalities&period;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>ðŸŒ¿ <span class="bolded">Thank you for reviewing my work&excl;</span> If you have questions or would like to chat with me about my process&comma; connect with me on LinkedIn&excl; I look forward to learning from your thoughts and feedback&period; ðŸ¥³</p>
