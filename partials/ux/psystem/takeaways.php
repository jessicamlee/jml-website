        <h2>Takeaways: Impact &amp; Next Steps
        <p>For an internship experience, I am grateful to have the opportunity to take the lead in updating the select webpages to support Psystemâ€™s upcoming marketing campaign and business goals in driving conversions and providing informative value and resources to their users.</p>
        <h3>âœ¨ How my work impacted the company</h3>
        <p>To track the visitors on the website while advocating for cookie consent, I got permission to add a Cookie Consent app provided by Elfsight. The regular updates from Elfsightâ€™s insight reveal more than 200 monthly view visits 2 weeks into the month, which was an increase of around 33% in website visits.</p>

        <p>Psystemâ€™s founder expressed appreciation for bringing their vision to life with limited visual references provided to me. Including them in every step within and beyond the design process provided more confidence to them about how the project was progressing and set clear expectations for the end result.</p>
        <h3>ðŸŒ± What I learned</h3>
        <p>While I learned a lot more about myself when putting my user experience design and research, project management, and curious learning mindset to the test, the most memorable lessons I learned are the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Research is my best friend whether I am trying to learn more about the competitors, users, market, expectations, or technologies used to implement the design, there is always something for me to learn and consider in the empathizing and planning stages of a project;</li>
            <li>Asking about the existing research to learn more about what the company has established or may not have explored yet also further validates the product-market fit that can influence the design process;</li>
            <li>Starting the conversation early with stakeholders to set expectations about an iterative design process helped me demonstrate my domain knowledge and care for the design and businessâ€™s resources from a project management standpoint;</li>
            <li>Asking questions reduces future problems as everyone can have different interpretations and connotations of the same idea, so good communication helps to ensure everyone involved arrives at the same agreed-upon end result; and</li>
            <li>Providing regular updates through messages and video conferences early on sets the expectation to encourage constant, good communication throughout the project, which is especially helpful if or when a problem arises.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>ðŸ“Œ Next Steps</h3>
        <p>To further optimize the webpages to increase conversions, I would like to</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Learn what is and is not supporting an intuitive and accessible user experience across all of Psytemâ€™s webpages by analyzing the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and other measured analytics;</li>
            <li>Conduct more formal usability tests with users beyond Psytemâ€™s internal testers to learn about overlooked behaviour and pain points that can be addressed to make the website more accessible for chronic pain sufferers and their caretakers; and</li>
            <li>Research more on the website-to-mobile application user journey to support a seamless user journey that supports Psystemâ€™s business goals in connecting the value of the website and the mobile applicationâ€™s functionalities.</li>
        </ul>
