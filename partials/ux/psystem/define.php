        <ul>
            <li><span class="bolded">Users want Dedicated Pages&colon;</span> 2 of 5 participants expected more details for each service on a separate page to feel comfortable with different pieces of information all in one section&period;</li>
            <li><span class="bolded">Consistent Font Styles&colon;</span> All participants expected cohesive font styles for trust and readability of content&period;</li>
            <li><span class="bolded">Navigation Improvements&colon;</span> 3 of 5 participants rapidly tapped and searched for consistent menus&comma; searching for easier navigation&period;</li>
            <li><span class="bolded">Scannable Content Organization&colon;</span> Users wanted improved readability for the content on desktop and mobile experiences&period;</li>
