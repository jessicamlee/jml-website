                        <h2>Takeaways</h2>
                        <p>After completing two prior projects, I learned that I brainstormed different questions to better empathize with the users and identify overlooked pain points from before the research process.</p>
                        <p>Testing and observing the key differences, strengths, and weaknesses of LOCLO Clothing’s competitors helped me better understand how users prioritize visual elements before reading textual content.</p>

                        <p>The usability tests helped me learn more about users’ behaviour, such as users preferring to experiment with the interface by selecting any clickable item or rounded element.</p>
                        <p>Taking note of these actions helped me learn about users’ expectations that were not verbally expressed or that all users aware of their actions.</p>

                        <p class="mb-sm">With more time, I would like to add more details and make additional changes to improve the website to be more accessible to users. Here are the first three steps I would want to take:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><span class="bolded">Consider Secondary Audience:</span> I would like to learn how a parent or a more mature user navigates the interface and what challenges they would face.</li>
                            <li><span class="bolded">More Diverse Testing Group:</span> With accessibility in mind, I would like to test and learn how to improve the design to support shoppers with a permanent, temporary, or situational disability that prevents them from exploring the entire website or mobile application.</li>
                            <li><span class="bolded">Developing Other Pages:</span> With more pages, users will be navigating additional steps that can make the shopping experience more complex and prone to errors. I would like to create more pages that require different layouts to challenge myself to learn how to improve the design to avoid information overload.</li>
