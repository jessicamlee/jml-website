                        <p>The Usability Testing Results for both mobile application and website interfaces provided further insights about unidentified pain points and simple revisions that can improve the ease of access to the interface&period;</p>
                        <p>The new pain points discovered from the Usability Study included insufficient emphasis on call&dash;to&dash;action buttons and links and unclear progression for the checkout experience as many users unexpectedly misclicked on non&dash;clickable areas on the screen&period;</p>

                        <h2>Reflecting on the Challenges</h2>
                        <p>From the Usability Tests using UseBerry, I gathered a few solutions to apply to the screens to reduce confusion about how to proceed with the next task, boost users’ confidence for the entire journey, and increase excitement about completing a purchase.</p>
                        <p class="mb-sm">The <span class="bolded">proposed and applied solutions</span> include the following&colon;</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Emphasize section item on the User Account page&semi;</li>
                            <li>Reorganize components to above the fold&semi;</li>
                            <li>Remove emphasis on the Discount Code field and Checkout Navigation bar&semi;</li>
                            <li>Focus users’ attention on Payment input fields&semi; and</li>
                            <li>Encourage users to review information on the Review page to reduce errors&period;</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Below are three examples of the high-fidelity wireframes before and after the Usability Study that significantly impact the user’s shopping experience:</p>
