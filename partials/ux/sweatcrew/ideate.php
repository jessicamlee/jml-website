                    <p>Adding Accordions to the quick links above the footer extended the mobile experience as many of The Sweat Crew&apos;s competitors and popular clothing brands like Nike support their mobile visitors by having as much top&dash;down information available to help users meet their needs and reduce abandoned experiences&period;</p>
                    <p>Another benefit and priority is to reduce the amount of endless scrolling experience for mobile users as a common complaint I discovered from the initial interviews was the discomfort of gesturing the thumb continuously&period;</p>
