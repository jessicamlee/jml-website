        <h2>Identifying Expectations</h2>
        <p>Translating my character analysis skills&comma; I sought to observe and understand user&apos;s expectations <span class="bolded">before&comma; during&comma; and after deciding to pay</span> for a digital subscription service&period;</p>
        <p>Secondary research led to the idea of <span class="bolded">merging the Settings and Profile screens</span> to <span class="bolded">meet user expectations in managing their memberships</span>&comma; facilitating a <span class="bolded">smoother experience</span> to manage everything in one place&period;</p>
