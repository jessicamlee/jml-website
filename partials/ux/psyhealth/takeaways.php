        <p>With PsyHealth&apos;s ongoing&comma; iterative growth&comma; I gained new insights from my responsibilities during each sprint&period;</p>
        <h3>âœ¨ How my work made a positive impact</h3>
        <p>With designs still in development&comma; the way to validate and improve my work is by asking for feedback&colon;</p>

            <p class="italic">&ldquo;I like that everything is on one page or screen for the profile and settings sections&period; It&apos;s quicker to manage subscriptions and payment details in one place&period;&rdquo;</p>

        <h2>Retrospective</h2>
        <h3>ðŸŒ± Lessons Learned</h3>
        <p>Contributing to PsyHealth introduced me to varied file structures&comma; fostering insights from past designers and developers&period; I further developed my skills in&colon;</p> 
        <ul>
            <li><span class="bolded">Expanded user interview efforts</span>&comma; and posed additional open&dash;ended questions to <span class="bolded">uncover previously unexplored edge case scenarios</span>&semi;</li>
            <li>Actively listened to tester feedback&comma;<span class="bolded">gaining insights into user expectations</span> and <span class="bolded">identifying areas for improvement</span> in future design iteration&semi; and</li>
            <li><span class="bolded">Learned about unforeseen user considerations</span> during internal quality assurance tests&period;</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Optimized project management with relevant questions</h4>
        <p>In the latest iteration&comma; I gained a crucial developer&apos;s perspective&comma; asking myself the following questions&colon;</p> 
        <ul>
            <li>Considering our Minimum Viable Product &lpar;MVP&rpar; timeline and team resources&comma; <span class="bolded">is this feature and approach feasible for our current sprint</span>&quest;</li>
            <li><span class="bolded">What other information do I need to know</span> about regarding the data inputted&comma; saved&comma; updated, and deleted from our back-end server&quest;</li>
            <li><span class="bolded">What features are a concern for development</span> that still need to be addressed&quest;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Asking these questions boosted my early creativity and sparked inspiration&period; I collaborated with key collaborators to understand data handling and <span class="bolded">translate it into the payment experience</span>&period;</p> 
        <h3>ðŸ“Œ Next Steps</h3>
        <p>In an ideal situation&comma; I would like to&colon;</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="bolded">Continue conducting user interviews</span>and usability tests to lead A&sol;B unit testing for future sprints and design iterations&semi;</li>
            <li>Enhance error support and interface accessibility<span class="bolded"> for both primary and secondary target audiences&semi; and</li>
            <li><span class="bolded">Conduct external usability testing</span> to <span class="bolded">identify new user insights</span> with archetypes&comma; personas&comma; and empathy maps for PsyHealth&period;</li>
        </ul>
