        <h2>Takeaways</h2>
        <p>With PsyHealth&apos;s ongoing&comma; iterative growth&comma; I gained new insights from the roles of a UX Researcher and UX Designer from each sprint&period;</p>
        <p>Before I share my lessons learned&comma; below is a quote from an internal tester&apos;s feedback on the proposed profile screen revision&colon;</p>

            <p class="bolded-italic">One quote from usability test participant feedback&colon;</p>
            <p class="italic">&ldquo;I like that everything is on one page or screen for the profile and settings sections&period; It&apos;s quicker to manage subscriptions and payment details in one place&period;&rdquo;</p>

        <h3>ðŸŒ± What I Learned</h3>
        <p>Supporting the PsyHealth app taught me how to learn from previous designers and developers as the project&apos;s working files are set up in a different way than I am accustomed to&period;</p> 
        <p>From conducting more user interviews and asking additional open&dash;ended questions&comma; I learned about <span class="bolded">edge case scenarios</span> that I had yet to consider before we completed our internal quality assurance tests&period;</p>
        <p>Listening to the testers <span class="bolded">share their thoughts and feelings</span> when encountering a different outcome than they expected provided more insight into what PsyHealth&apos;s users are looking for and what we can include in future design iterations&period;</p>
        <p class="mb-sm">An <span class="bolded">additional and important perspective I gained</span> from the latest iteration is the developer&apos;s point of view&period; I asked myself the following questions&comma;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>&ldquo;Is this feature and approach feasible for our current sprint&comma; considering our Minimum Viable Product &lpar;MVP&rpar; timeline and team resources&quest;&rdquo;</li>
            <li>&ldquo;What other information do I need to know about regarding the data inputted&comma; saved&comma; updated&comma; and deleted from our back&dash;end server&quest;&rdquo;</li>
            <li>&ldquo;What features are a concern for development that have not been addressed yet&quest;&rdquo;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With those questions&comma; I helped reduce the chances of feeling burnt out from all the possibilities and ideas I <span class="italic">could</span> pursue&period; I then knew <span class="italic">who</span> to speak with&comma; such as the back&dash;end developer&comma; to <span class="bolded">understand how the data is saved and presented to the end user</span> to translate that process to the user&apos;s interface for this payment experience&period;</p>
        <h3>ðŸ“Œ Next Steps</h3>
        <p>Although there are project limitations&comma; in an ideal situation &lpar;possibly in the future&rpar;&comma; I would like to continue conducting user interviews and usability tests to lead A&sol;B unit testing for future sprints and design iterations&period;</p>
        <p>From further moderated usability tests&comma; I aim to improve the experience by <span class="bolded">adding more support for errors</span> and <span class="bolded">making the interface more intuitive and accessible</span> as the secondary target audience would also benefit from this support in addition to PsyHealth&apos;s offerings and services&period;</p>
        <p>I would also like to support and <span class="bolded">lead external usability testing</span> to gather a larger pool of data from different users to identify potential new archetypes&comma; personas&comma; and user journeys&comma; and create additional empathy maps to define further and <span class="bolded">better understand PsyHealth&apos;s users</span>&period;</p>
        <p>ðŸŒ¿ <span class="bolded">Thank you for reviewing my work&excl;</span> If you have questions or would like to chat with me about my process&comma; connect with me on LinkedIn&excl; I look forward to learning from your thoughts and feedback&period; ðŸ¥³</p>
