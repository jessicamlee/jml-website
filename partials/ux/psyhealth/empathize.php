                    <p>My research began with Psystem&apos;s competitors by exploring their mobile application offerings and user experiences first&dash;hand to observe their strengths and identify opportunities for improvement&period; I wanted to understand how &lpar;and if&rpar; the competitors addressed the following tasks&colon;</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Browse and explore PsyHealth App&apos;s Premium and Free functions&comma; Premium benefits&comma; and available Pathway courses&semi;</li>
                        <li>Select and confirm payment for a subscription or purchase&semi; and</li>
                        <li>Receive feedback for successful and unsuccessful payments &lpar;as per the back&dash;end developer&apos;s request&rpar;&period;</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Another task I found would be useful from my competitive research is to <span class="bolded">combine our current Settings and Profile screens into one screen</span> for users to modify information and payment details in the same place&period;</p>
            <p>Having all administrative details updated on one screen would reduce the number of clicks and steps a user needs to take to reach their goal of editing their profile&comma; settings&comma; and payment information&comma; which would lead to a more positive user experience&period;</p>
            <p><span class="bolded">&rarr; Impact&colon; </span>From the moderated usability testing for the low&dash;fidelity wireframes&comma; the usability test participants confirmed that they preferred having everything on one screen to review&comma; especially when exploring the app in a small&comma; mobile screen size&period;</p>
