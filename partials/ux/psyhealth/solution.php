        <h2>Solution&colon; What needs to be done first&quest;</h2>
        <h3>Empathize</h3>
        <p>Translating my character analysis skills&comma; I sought to observe and understand user&apos;s expectations before&comma; during&comma; and after choosing to pay for a digital subscription service&period;</p>
        <h4>Secondary Research&colon; Outlining Expectations</h4>
        <p>I compared PsyHealth&apos;s user journeys with competitors and <span class="bolded">suggested merging the Settings and Profile screens</span>&period;</p>
        <p>Combining the administrative details into one screen reduces clicks&comma; making it easier for users to edit their information for a better experience while meeting expectations&period;</p>

        <h3>Define</h3>
        <p>From the pre&dash;determined personas&comma; user interviews&comma; and competitor research&comma; I visualized my insights into maps and flow charts to communicate the user's pain points and my suggestions to my team&period;</p>
        <p>I iterated based on my team&apos;s feedback&comma; leading to my final draft that best reflects an improved user journey during payment decision&dash;making and completion steps&period;</p>

        <h3>Ideate&comma; Test&comma; Iterate&colon; Why this change&quest;</h3>
        <p>Feedback on my low&dash;fidelity wireframes revealed <span class="bolded">layouts depend on content context</span>&period; The mid&dash;fidelity wireframes with accurate copy led to iterations to the monthly and annual subscription plan placements&period;</p>
        <p>Through A&sol;B testing to streamline user focus on payment decisions&comma; having two options helped my team&apos;s decision&dash;making and support for faster development&period;</p>

        <p>Besides internal testing&comma; an external team will evaluate the app&period; Excited to gather their insights for further design iterations&excl;</p>
