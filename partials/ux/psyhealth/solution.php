        <h2>Solution&colon; How I approached this
        <h3>Empathize</h3>
        <h4>Understanding the Competitors and Users</h4>
        <p>My research began with Psystem&apos;s competitors by exploring their mobile application offerings and user experiences first&dash;hand to observe their strengths and identify opportunities for improvement&period; I wanted to understand how &lpar;and if&rpar; the competitors addressed the following tasks&colon;</p>
        <ul class="mb-lg">
            <li>Browse and explore PsyHealth App&apos;s Premium and Free functions&comma; Premium benefits&comma; and available Pathway courses&semi;</li>
            <li>Select and confirm payment for a subscription or purchase&semi; and</li>
            <li>Receive feedback for successful and unsuccessful payments &lpar;as per the back&dash;end developer&apos;s request&rpar;&period;</li>
        </ul>

            <img class="img-thumb" src="images/case-studies/psyhealth/psyhealth_userresearch.jpg" alt="Screenshots of Affinity Map, Empathy Maps, and User Journey Maps created for understanding PsyHealth's payment user experience">

        </div>
        <p class="mt-md">Another task I found would be useful from my competitive research is to <span class="bolded">combine our current Settings and Profile screens into one screen</span> for users to modify information and payment details in the same place&period;</p>
        <p>Having all administrative details updated on one screen would reduce the number of clicks and steps a user needs to take to reach their goal of editing their profile&comma; settings&comma; and payment information&comma; which would lead to a more positive user experience&period;</p>
        <p><span class="bolded">&rarr; Impact&colon; </span>From the moderated usability testing for the low&dash;fidelity wireframes&comma; the usability test participants confirmed that they preferred having everything on one screen to review&comma; especially when exploring the app in a small&comma; mobile screen size&period;</p>
        <h3>Define</h3>
        <h4>Defining the User&apos;s Experience</h4>
        <p>As for user research&comma; I interviewed the primary target audience that aligned with the pre&dash;determined personas and archetypes to gather qualitative data and observations to understand the user&apos;s thought process&comma; feelings&comma; pain points&comma; and desire for the payment experience&period;</p>
        <p>I translated my findings by creating an Affinity Map&comma; Empathy Maps&comma; User Stories&comma; User Journey Maps&comma; User Problem Statements&comma; and a User Goal Statement&comma; which also helped me outline the essential screens to prioritize for this sprint&period;</p>

            <img class="img-thumb" src="images/case-studies/psyhealth/psyhealth_usergoal.jpg" alt="Screenshot User Goal Statement with the following text: Our PsyHealth App with Premium Subscription and Pathway courses will let users input all their health notes, review health analytics, and embark on their wellness journey with a self-paced guided course which will affect chronic pain sufferers and individuals who are keen on improving their health by providing one app that will support their goals and needs.">

        <p class="mt-md">By visualizing the user&apos;s experience&comma; I summarized how designing the Payment Experience for subscriptions and course purchases would affect the primary target audience &lpar;as the current sprint is focused on the Minimum Viable Product &lpar;MVP&rpar;&rpar;&period;</p>
        <p>From the defined user stories and diagrams&comma; I began iterating through the Crazy Eights Method using pen and paper to quickly ideate the most impactful screens that will help the users reach their goals and complete their tasks in the shortest journey possible&period;</p>
        <p><span class="bolded">&rarr; Impact&colon; </span>Having visualized outlines of the user&apos;s journey along with the corresponding user stories supported my conversations with the product owner and usability test participants to identify specific areas of improvement within the user&apos;s journey&period; More details are provided in the next section&comma; &ldquo;Takeaways&period;&rdquo;</p>
