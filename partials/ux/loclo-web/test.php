        <h2>Test &amp; Iterate</h2>
        <div class="cs-subsection">
            <p>I conducted an unmoderated usability study using the Useberry testing tool to determine how intuitive the first version of the high&dash;fidelity prototype is based on a specific path users need to execute&period;</p>
            <p><span class="bolded">Method&colon;</span> Throughout the usability test&comma; the questions below can be answered to improve the initial high&dash;fidelity prototype design for a more accessible and intuitive shopping experience for the primary &lpar;and secondary&rpar; target audience&period;</p>
            <p>With a more straightforward shopping experience&comma; the design can reduce the chances of abandoned checkout and user experience rates to support the company&apos;s quarterly and financial goals&period;</p>
            <p class="bolded mb-sm">Questions to Address&colon;</p>
            <ul class="mb-md">
                <li>How can the designs be modified to be more intuitive for users to complete the tasks&quest;</li>
                <li>How can the checkout process be optimized &lpar;to reduce abandoned cart rates&rpar;&quest;</li>
                <li>What could users need clarification about that leads to an abandoned shopping experience&quest;</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Based on the user scenario and user flow&comma; the tasks for the usability study were as follows&colon;</p>
            <ol class="mb-md">
                <li>Log in to Account &lpar;on the Home page&rpar;</li>
                <li>Find Saved Items &lpar;on the Account page&rpar;</li>
                <li>View Saved Items &lpar;on the Account page&rpar;</li>
                <li>Add Saved Item to Cart &lpar;visit the Product page and add from the Product page&rpar;</li>
                <li>Proceed to Checkout &lpar;from the Cart Pop-up Modal Box&rpar;</li>
                <li>Complete Your Purchase &lpar;from the Cart page to the Confirmation page&rpar;</li>
            </ol>
            <p>After each task&comma; I added a call&dash;to&dash;action prompt&comma; &ldquo;Where would you click to complete &lsqb;said task&rsqb;&quest;&rdquo; to include the tasks at each step of the study&period;</p>
            <p>When users complete the tasks in the study&comma; they are asked to answer four questions about their experience engaging with the usability test&period; The questions were as follows&colon;</p>
            <ol class="mb-md">
                <li>How would you rate your experience&quest; &lpar;Likert Scale&rpar;</li>
                <li>How likely would you share this website with a friend&quest; &lpar;Likert Scale&rpar;</li>
                <li>What part of the experience do you like the most&quest; &lpar;Short Text Answer&rpar;</li>
                <li>What part of the experience do you like the least&quest; &lpar;Short Text Answer&rpar;</li>
            </ol>
            <p>After completing the four questions&comma; users are thanked for their time to complete the study&period;</p>

        <div class="cs-subsection">
            <h3>Usability Study Findings &amp; Solutions</h3>
            <p>The Usability Test was mostly successful with a 100&percnt; completion rate and an average time of 2 minutes and 30 seconds to complete all the tasks&period; The success rate plummeted from 100&percnt; to 80&percnt; for Task #3 &ldquo;View Saved Item&rdquo; and to 40&percnt; for Task #5 &ldquo;Proceed to Checkout&period;&rdquo;</p>
            <p>After reviewing the heatmaps and clicks map for each successful and unsuccessful screen&comma; the appropriate solutions concluded to improve the overall level of usability and accessibility are as follows&colon;</p>
            <ol class="mb-md">
                <li>Add a border to the first section item when the user hovers over it on the User Account page&period;</li>
                <li>Resize and reorganize components to above the fold on the User Account page&period;</li>
                <li>Remove the drop shadow for the Discount Code field and resize the Checkout Breadcrumb Navigation bar to a smaller size on the Cart page&period;</li>
                <li>Make the &ldquo;Cart Items&rdquo; dropdown smaller &lpar;in addition to shrinking the Checkout Breadcrumb Navigation bar&rpar; and move input fields above the fold on the Payment page&period;</li>
                <li>Modify down arrows to appear more clickable like a button to encourage users to review the information before completing checkout on the Review page&period;</li>
            </ol>
            <p><span class="bolded">Expected Impact after Updates&colon;</span> Through the above&dash;suggested solutions&comma; users are expected to feel less confused about how to proceed with the next step&comma; more confident about where to click on a page&comma; and more excited to complete their purchase on the website&period;</p>
            <p>The revised design will also shorten the time taken for the entire process and provide ease of mind for both the users and the company about their purchases and saved items&period;</p>
        </div>
        <div class="cs-subsection">
            <h3>Second Iteration Prototype Updates</h3>
            <p>The new pain points discovered from the Usability Study included insufficient emphasis on call&dash;to&dash;action buttons and links and unclear progression for the checkout experience as many users unexpectedly misclicked on non&dash;clickable areas on the screen&period;</p>
            <p>The following screenshots provide a comparison of the before and after mockups of the screens with the areas of improvement from the first usability study&period;</p>

                    <p>When reviewing the unmoderated usability testing recordings&comma; I noticed usability participants were spam&dash;clicking all over the page and not many of them scolded past the fold&period; I inferred that it seemed like the usability participants could have been confused about where to navigate after reading the prompt&period;</p>
                    <p><span class="bolded">Changes made&colon; </span>Revised the components on the account page to fit above the fold and added emphasis on the first &ldquo;Saved Items&rdquo; tab to help users identify where they are within their LOCLO dashboard&period;</p>

                    <p>During the usability study&comma; usability participants were observed clicking the breadcrumb icons to test what the icons could do&comma; not scrolling past the fold&comma; and clicking on the discount code field to trial&dash;and&dash;error the next step to continue&period;</p>
                    <p><span class="bolded">Changes made&colon; </span>Since the prompt for this step was to continue the usability participant&apos;s shopping experience by completing the purchase&comma; I reorganized the components and content on the page to fit above the fold to reduce the chances of users abandoning the experience due to not being to see the &ldquo;Continue&rdquo; call&dash;to&dash;action button above the fold&period;</p>

                    <p>Although the focus for the third challenge is not specifically on resolving abandoned shopping experiences&comma; sometimes the long payment input&comma; review&comma; and confirmation can make the final steps of the shopping experience feel long and overwhelming&period;</p>
                    <p>I noticed usability testers did not review the information on the payment page before confirming their purchase&period; From a handful of articles and listening to friends share their stories about incorrect payment information entered for their online purchases&comma; I wanted to ensure LOCLO&apos;s online orders did not face a similar issue&period;</p>
                    <p><span class="bolded">Changes made&colon; </span>Instead of down arrows&comma; I replaced the edit trigger buttons with a pencil icon to encourage users to click the icons as the usability testers proved that users like to trial and error with spam&dash;clicking the interface &lpar;from my observations of this usability study&rpar;&period;</p>
