        <h2>Takeaways</h2>
        <p>After completing two prior projects&comma; I learned that I brainstormed different questions to better empathize with the users and identify overlooked pain points from before the research process&period;</p>
        <p>Testing and observing the key differences&comma; strengths&comma; and weaknesses of LOCLO Clothing&apos;s competitors helped me better understand how users prioritize visual elements before reading textual content&period;</p>

            <p class="bolded-italic">One quote from user feedback:</p>
            <p class="italic">&ldquo;Seeing saved items were easy to complete and quick to figure out even though it wasn&apos;t an expected task&period;&rdquo;</p>

        </div>
        <h3>ðŸŒ± What I Learned</h3>
        <p>The usability tests helped me learn more about users&apos; behaviour&comma; such as users preferring to experiment with the interface by selecting any clickable item or rounded element&period;</p> 
        <p>Taking note of these actions helped me learn about users&apos; expectations that were not verbally expressed or that all users were aware of their actions&period;</p>
        <p><span class="bolded">Most Important&colon; </span>Depending on the designer&comma; sometimes the terms&comma; &ldquo;wireframes&rdquo; and &ldquo;mockups&comma;&rdquo; can be used interchangeably&period; I learned about this when comparing notes between instructors and online articles&period; Note to self&comma; research as much as you can and get to know your audience before the next presentation&excl;</p>
        <h3>ðŸ“Œ Next Steps</h3>
        <p class="mb-sm">With more time&comma; I would like to add more details and make additional changes to improve the website to be more accessible to users&period; Here are the first three steps I would want to take&colon;</p>
        <ol>
            <li><span class="bolded">Consider Secondary Audience&colon;</span> I would like to learn how a parent or a more mature user navigates the interface and what challenges they would face as word&dash;of&dash;mouth is a strong marketing approach for small businesses&comma; and making the website accessible to the secondary audience can help boost traffic and visibility of the website&period;</li>
            <li><span class="bolded">Test again with a more diverse group&colon;</span> With accessibility in mind&comma; I would like to test and learn how to improve the design to support shoppers with a permanent&comma; temporary&comma; or situational disability that prevents them from exploring the entire website or mobile application&period;</li>
            <li><span class="bolded">Create supplementary pages to support the shopping experience&colon;</span> With more pages&comma; users will be navigating additional steps that can make the shopping experience more complex and prone to errors&period; I would like to create more pages that require different layouts to challenge myself to learn how to improve the design to avoid information overload&period;</li>
        </ol>
        <p>ðŸŒ¿ <span class="bolded">Thank you for reviewing my work&excl;</span> If you have questions or would like to chat with me about my process&comma; connect with me on LinkedIn&excl; I look forward to learning from your thoughts and feedback&period; ðŸ¥³</p>
