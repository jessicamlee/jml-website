            <p>From defining the user goal statement&comma; the user&apos;s goal statement can be formed to synthesize how LOCLO&apos;s website will perform to positively impact users like the Sarah Smith persona to deliver a valuable experience&period; How the impact will be measured will also be noted in the user goal statement in the following format&colon;</p>
