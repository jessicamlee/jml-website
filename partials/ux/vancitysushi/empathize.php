            <h3>Researching</h3>
            <p>Before launching&comma; we need to understand specific challenges users may face when placing an order and accumulating points and how we can resolve those challenges&period;</p>
            <p>My first steps started with empathizing with the users through storyboarding the big picture and a close&dash;up scenario before defining the research goals and questions to address&period;</p>

                <h4>My Assumptions</h4>
                <p>My assumptions before the research phase are that the participants order sushi at least once a week &lpar;or a few times a month&rpar; and prefer to gather and use points to save money on future orders&period;</p>
                <p>Learning about how some customers forget to log into the app to accumulate points changed my assumptions&period; I also learned that avid point&dash;acquiring customers prefer to have more point promotions weekly rather than a static system&period;</p>

        <div class="cs-subsection">
            <h3>Competitive Analysis &amp; Pain Points</h3>
            <p>While I gathered information about the users&comma; I also learned about the direct and indirect competitors of Vancity Sushi&period;</p>
            <p>Besides other food ordering apps like UberEats and SkiptheDishes&comma; Vancity Sushi&apos;s direct competitors are the nearby restaurants that use a website ordering platform to process online orders&period;</p>
            <p class="mb-sm">The primary weaknesses I noticed among the competitors are&colon;</p>
            <ol class="mb-md">
                <li>Lack of written descriptions and audio options</li>
                <li>Inconsistency with images for visual aid</li>
                <li>No mobile app is available &lpar;or mobile app is available in certain locations&rpar;</li>
                <li>Absence of a “Notes” field to specify food allergies or dietary preferences</li>
                <li>Missing updated Points page after purchase</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="cs-subsection">
            <h3>Outlining the Journey</h3>
            <p>After gathering information about the users and the competitors&comma; it is time to begin outlining the journey&period; I constructed a user flow and user flow diagram to outline the steps a user would take to place an order through the app&period;</p>

                <div class="cs-half-width">
                    <p>Working on and iterating the User Flow helped me visualize the process&comma; identify missing steps&comma; and understand the successes and frustrations users may face along the way&period;</p>
                    <p>I worked on the User Flow activity using the pen&dash;and&dash;paper method&comma; or pencil&dash;and&dash;paper method in this attempt&comma; as I found it easier for me to output ideas as quickly as I could&period;</p>
                    <p>After outputting the ideas onto a page&comma; I can then revise and reorganize each point to create a final and cleaner draft to refer to&period;</p>

            <p>Following the User Flow activity&comma; I brainstormed a specific scenario a user&comma; such as the Mikayla persona&comma; may take to order through the app&period;</p>
            <p>Creating the User Journey Map helped me empathize with the user and persona better because I worked through the subtasks within each overarching task and identified specific improvement opportunities that may not have been apparent to consider before creating the wireframes&period;</p>
