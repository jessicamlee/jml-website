        <h2>Takeaways</h2>

            <p class="bolded-italic">One quote from user feedback:</p>
            <p class="italic">&ldquo;Seeing what to redeem&comma; details for &lsqb;the&rsqb; confirmation &lsqb;page&rsqb;&comma; and all the colours and pictures&hellip; the app is easy to use&period; I would recommend this app to a family or friend&period;&rdquo;</p>

        <h3>ðŸŒ± What I Learned</h3>
        <p>When designing Vancity Sushi&apos;s app&comma; I learned to prioritize the essential components first to create a simple&dash;to&dash;use platform for users to place an order quickly&period;</p> 
        <p>Through usability studies&comma; I learned which components were helpful&comma; and how other elements deterred users from completing the task&period;</p>
        <p>Speaking to participants helped me learn about various users&apos; perspectives to understand how different backgrounds&comma; upbringings&comma; and lived experiences influence what they want and how they interact with the app&period;</p>
        <h3>ðŸ“Œ Next Steps</h3>
        <p class="mb-sm">While the latest high&dash;fidelity prototype has a more presentable appearance&comma; there is room for improvement&period; With more time and research&comma; here are a few steps I would like to take to upgrade the app&period;</p>
        <ol>
            <li><span class="bolded">Add a Reminder or Notification Nudge when in-store&colon;</span> This feature would assist personas like Carl to remind them to scan their customer loyalty app when they are near a store location using in-app GPS detection to encourage users to scan to save their points and benefit from future discounts&period;</li>
            <li><span class="bolded">Add Detailed Descriptions&colon;</span> Providing more details for item descriptions will clarify what a dish is for users unfamiliar with it or who need to check ingredient details for dietary and allergy reasons&period;</li>
            <li><span class="bolded">Include a Profile Page&colon;</span> Having a Profile page will help returning users update billing and delivery information for a speedy checkout process in the future&period;</li>
            <li><span class="bolded">Conduct Another Usability Study&colon;</span> Learning more about pain points that have not been addressed yet from more users will help determine any new areas of need&period;</li>
        </ol>
        <p>ðŸŒ¿ <span class="bolded">Thank you for reviewing my work&excl;</span> If you have questions or would like to chat with me about my process&comma; connect with me on LinkedIn&excl; I look forward to learning from your thoughts and feedback&period; ðŸ¥³</p>
