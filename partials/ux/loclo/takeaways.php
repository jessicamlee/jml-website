                <p class="italic">&ldquo;The Checkout pages are usually separate on other sites&comma; which feels like a long journey&period; I like that &lsqb;The Sweat Crew&apos;s checkout process&rsqb; is on the same page&excl;&rdquo;</p>

            <h3>What I Learned</h3>
            <p>Researching&comma; planning&comma; and creating a user experience design for various screens require more time than developing one screen&period;</p> 
            <p>Although the content is relatively the same for desktop&comma; tablet&comma; and mobile experiences&comma; I learned from the user feedback about how the components are organized impacts the user&apos;s satisfaction and first impressions of the product or service&period;</p>
            <p>From speaking with usability study participants&comma; I could iterate the design appropriately&comma; effectively&comma; and efficiently for the intended audience&period;</p>
            <p>The Sweat Crew project taught me more about other components to consider when thinking about accessibility&period; I also learned more about information architecture when completing the site map&period;</p>
            <p>In addition to wireframing and prototyping&comma; the above lessons I&apos;ve learned widened my perspective about more components to consider as a designer&period;</p>

            <h3>Next Steps</h3>
            <p class="mb-sm">With more time&comma; I would like to add more details and make additional changes to improve the website to be more accessible to users&period; Here are the first 3 steps I would want to take&colon;</p>
            <ol>
                <li><span class="bolded">Add Alt Text&colon;</span> I add alternative text to my portfolio to make it easier for users with screen readers. With more time&comma; I want to add alternative text to all the images on the website&period;</li>
                <li><span class="bolded">Add More Animation&colon;</span> Having more animation or video clips of the products may appear more engaging and accessible on different screen sizes&period;</li>
                <li><span class="bolded">Add Landmarks&colon;</span> Although the headings do help guide users&comma; landmarks can further assist anyone who wants to use their keyboard more&period; This would be especially useful for the Step 2 Customization page&period;</li>
