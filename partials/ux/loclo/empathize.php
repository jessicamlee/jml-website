            <h3>Researching</h3>
            <p>For the LOCLO Clothing project&comma; I combined my knowledge from past projects&comma; like the <a href="../ux-design/vancitysushi.php" title="Link to Vancity Sushi UX Case Study" target="_blank">Vancity Sushi project</a> and <a href="../ux-design/thesweatcrew.php" title="Link to Sweat Crew UX Case Study" target="_blank">The Sweat Crew project</a>&comma; to design a cohesive cross&dash;platform experience&period;</p>
            <p><span class="bolded">Research Goals&colon;</span> The primary goal is to <span class="bolded-italic">understand the user&apos;s expectations</span> for a cross&dash;platform experience on both the website and mobile application interfaces&comma; create a <span class="bolded-italic">cohesive experience to maintain brand consistency</span> for both experiences&comma; and make the experience <span class="bolded-italic">accessible</span> and <span class="bolded-italic">user&dash;friendly</span>&period;</p>
            <p class="bolded mb-sm">Research Questions&colon;</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What do users expect to see to navigate the website more intuitively&quest;</li>
                <li>How does a user feel about navigating the website&quest;</li>
                <li>What challenges do users face when browsing the products and placing an order&quest;</li>
                <li>What are some ways to improve the experience&quest;</li>
                <li>How likely would users return to place another order in the future based on their experience&quest;</li>
                <li>What are the disregarded pain points in the low&dash;fidelity prototype&quest;</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Research Findings &amp; Pain Points</h3>
            <p>The User Research process started with looking for direct and indirect competitors&period;  I empathized with users by visiting similar clothing websites to LOCLO Clothing&apos;s offerings to understand the user flow and user journey that LOCLO&apos;s users would experience when searching and ordering clothes online&period;</p>
            <p>After researching and testing competitors&apos; websites and inquiring about mobile-to-website shopping experiences through one&dash;on&dash;one user interviews&comma; I found <span class="bolded">two primary pain points</span> to resolve in this project&apos;s iteration&colon;</p>
            <ol class="mb-md">
                <li><span class="bolded">Lack of Consistency&colon; </span>Some participants commented that they wanted more time to learn how to use the mobile application because the placement of elements was different compared to their expectations based on the website experience&period;</li>
                <li><span class="bolded">Long Shopping Experience on Mobile&colon; </span> Optimizing the number of steps for the shopping and checkout processes can help with abandoned and frustrating user experiences&period;</li>
            </ol>
            <p>In addition to the initial challenges previously outlined&comma; these pain points provide a more narrow focus&period;</p>
            <p>Identifying pain points helps designers like myself learn <span class="bolded-italic">how</span> designers to make custom ordering experiences more enjoyable&comma; especially since a lot of details are needed to complete the order&period;</p>
